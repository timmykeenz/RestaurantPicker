# RestaurantPicker
Picks a restaurant for you when you are indecisive.

  This project was made in my spare time to help choose a restaurant when I am feeling indecisive. This program reads in a file (in this case the fastFood.txt file) and assigns the values to restaurant objects.  The text file contains various restaurants and their menus.  The program prompts the user to enter how many people plan on eating.  It then chooses the restaurant and gives the users suggested meals to order from the menu.
